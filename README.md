# school_of_ai_kaggle_Inclusive_Images_Challenge
Hi Team,
the competition in which we will participate is this one https://www.kaggle.com/c/inclusive-images-challenge.

We will mainly use convolutional neural networks. The programming language I think is the best for us is python, 
but since we will have to build more models in order to increase the ability to generalize (generalization is in high demand in this competition) other languages like R will be fine too.
In this competition we have to properly label images. Labels of a sinlge image can be even more than 6. 

The action plan to tackle this challenge is almost ready, 
but I will wait for some of your suggestions or proposals in order to integrate them, so if you have any suggestions regarding possible models to solve the problem required by the competition do not hesitate to propose them here on the group or
to contact me.
Get ready to face this challenge !!!

Rember not to submit predictions with other accounts different from school_of_ai_kaggleTeam using models we use here as we can be disqualified
